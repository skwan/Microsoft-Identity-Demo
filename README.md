#Microsoft Identity Demo Application

How I built this application:
1. In Visual Studio 2015, File->New->Project->Visual C#->Web->ASP.Net Web Application.
2. MVC application with no authentication.
3. Followed the quickstart instructions from http://aka.ms/aadv2 for an ASP.Net MVC app.
4. Fixed up the sign in button following the branding recommendations on http://aka.ms/aadv2.
